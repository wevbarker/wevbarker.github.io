    I'm a theoretical cosmologist and Ph.D. candidate at the Kavli Institute for Cosmology, Cambridge (KICC), and the Cavendish Laboratory Astrophysics Group at the University of Cambridge. My research is focussed on gravitational theory and quantum gravity, and modifications to Einstein's general theory of relativity. 
</p>
<p>
I grew up in Cornwall, which is the south-western tip of England. I did my undergraduate and master's in Natural Sciences at Queens' College, Cambridge, and I've been based at Wolfson College during my Ph.D.

This site is still very much under construction! I can only barely speak <tt>html</tt> or <tt>ruby</tt>, so I apologise for all glitches. If you want to get in touch, feel free to drop me an email. Unfortunately, I don't use social media.
