<p>This page is a "clearinghouse" for blackboards and other resources collected from undergraduate teaching, a process which has become much easier since Girton college graciously assisted with the purchase of a <a href="https://www.wacom.com/en-gb">linux-compatible stylus</a> input!</p>
<h2>Oscillations, Waves and Optics</h2>
<p>
The "<i>Oscillations, waves and optics</i>" course is an ill-conceived collection of engineering concepts, written for 2nd-year undergraduates. There are two important things which are introduced in disguise, namely <b>hyperbolic systems</b> and <b>dispersion</b>. Both of these ideas play a role in actual physics. The small "<i>Experimental methods</i>" course is taught interstitially with this content: the name speaks for itself.

<h3>Lecture 2 (14:00-16:00 Thursday 20th October 2022)</h3>
<p>Note we did not complete a discussion of the "shunt" modification to ameliorate the low-frequency saturation of the integrator.</p>

<h3>2022 mock exam</h3>
<p>Two of the questions are copied from Tripos papers, one is sprinkled in for extra seasoning.</p>

<h2>Methods in Theoretical Physics</h2>
<p>The "<i>Methods</i>" were meant to be a series of informal discussions within the research group during the period where we had some great summer students with us. They tailed off after only a few weeks, but could perhaps be revivified in 2023 if someone wants to contribute content?</p>

<h2>Relativistic Astrophysics and Cosmology</h2>
<p>The "<i>Relativistic astrophysics and cosmology</i>" course is the Physics Department's idea of applied relativity, presented to fourth-year undergraduates. There are some good patches in the course, which was first constructed many years ago, and it is now improving with continued efforts by Dr. Handley.</p>
