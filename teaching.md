<p>This page is a "clearinghouse" for blackboards and other resources collected from undergraduate teaching, a process which has become much easier since Girton College graciously assisted with the purchase of a <a href="https://www.wacom.com/en-gb">linux-compatible stylus</a> input!</p>
<h2>Condensed Matter Physics</h2>
<p>
The "<i>Condensed matter physics</i>" course introduces some ultra-low-energy effective theories, particularly those which we commonly encounter in our narrowly-defined regime of existence well below the Planck scale. In this regime it is proposed that there are such things as crystals. Among them are metals: these are actually interesting, and give rise to such interesting models as Fermi liquid theory. You will not learn about Fermi liquid theory in this course. Some of you may find this course interesting, but beware: the correct route of entry into the condensed matter world is via the quantum dynamics/TP route which is on offer in Part II. Basically, if the course is designed and run by someone at the TCM group, then it can be trusted, but otherwise you should be suspicious.

<h3>Lecture 3 (14:00-16:00 Monday 17th May 2023)</h3>
<p>
Unfortunately, the deadline for my Master's students to submit their theses was at 16:00 BST today, and that led to a few (perfectly avoidable) crises throughout the morning. As a result, I failed to solve this week's solutions within my usual morning window. It is very unlikely I will return to this now, so please let me know if any of the problems need attention!
</p>
<h3>Lecture 2 (14:00-16:00 Monday 8th May 2023)</h3>

Diatomic phonon dispersion relations, reduced periodicity and folding of the Brilloin zone, splitting of acoustic and optical modes, crystal momentum. Debye theory, Dulong-Petit law, Planck distribution, bosonic occupancy of phonon modes, phonons as non-relativistic quantum field theories, phonon dispersion relations of sodium chloride and a silicon germanium superlattice, using normal mode intuition and reduced masses to infer splitting hierarchies.

<h2>Quantum Physics</h2>
<p>
The "<i>Quantum physics</i>" course offers an introduction to the non-relativistic quantum theory. Little or no attention is given to the axioms of quantum theory. Lots of emphasis is placed on the position ("<i>wave function</i>" or "<i>quantum wave</i>") representation for massive particles, which is mostly useless for physics in general and actively harmful for quantum field theory (QFT) in particular (there are some applications within quantum chemistry and experimental solid state physics). There is an introduction to the quantisation of orbital and intrinsic angular momentum, somehow without reference to the orthogonal or Lorentz groups.

<h2>Oscillations, Waves and Optics</h2>
<p>
The "<i>Oscillations, waves and optics</i>" course is an ill-conceived collection of engineering concepts, written for 2nd-year undergraduates. There are two important things which are introduced in disguise, namely <b>hyperbolic systems</b> and <b>dispersion</b>. Both of these ideas play a role in actual physics. The small "<i>Experimental methods</i>" course is taught interstitially with this content: the name speaks for itself.

<h2>Methods in Theoretical Physics</h2>
<p>The "<i>Methods</i>" were meant to be a series of informal discussions within the research group during the period where we had some great summer students with us. They tailed off after only a few weeks, but could perhaps be revivified in 2023 if someone wants to contribute content?</p>

<h2>Relativistic Astrophysics and Cosmology</h2>
<p>The "<i>Relativistic astrophysics and cosmology</i>" course is the Physics Department's idea of applied relativity, presented to fourth-year undergraduates. There are some good patches in the course, which was first constructed many years ago, and it is now improving with continued efforts by Dr. Handley.</p>
