I was at the <a href="http://geomgrav.fi.ut.ee/conf/geomgrav2023/index.php">GeomGrav conference in Tartu, Estonia</a>. 
This was described as "<i>a conference focusing upon the various approaches to gravity that go beyond the usual framework of general relativity</i>".
The <a href="https://button.ut.ee/b/lau-7td-gi5-kwy">linked talk</a> was given as part of the theory session on 22nd June, presenting the preliminary work on the PSALTer programme. I attach below the original slides. Apologies to Cillian Rew, whose photo for the closing slide arrived after the presentation was uploaded!

<h2>Perimeter Institute cosmology seminar</h2>
<p>
Here is a seminar I gave at PITP recently, which encodes much of my activity over the past few years.
