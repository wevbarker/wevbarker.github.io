		HiGGS provides tools for the Hamiltonian constraint analysis (canoncical analysis or Dirac-Bergmann algorithm) of gravity with spacetime curvature and torsion. HiGGS can be used on a desktop PC, but it is parallelised for theory surveys on clusters and supercomputers.

		The joke underpinning the figure on the right tends to need explaining. I have a colleague who likes to describe the Dirac-Bergmann algorithm as a "<i>sausage-making machine</i>". It is a fairly accurate description: the algorithm is un-intuitive and opaque, you never know what the dynamical content of your model is until the termination criteria are met.
