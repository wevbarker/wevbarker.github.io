The Cavendish Astrophysics Group at the Battcock Centre for Experimental Astrophysics, jointly with the Institute of Astronomy (I.o.A) and Kavli Institute for Cosmology, Cambridge (KICC), holds an informal seminar series at 11:15 UK time on Tuesday mornings, (mostly) during term time. By default, content is delivered in person by AP group students and researchers, the idea being to create a kind of "preprint server" for those of us who have more formal seminars and conference talks in their future lightcone. You can present anything, even just an exciting plot. For the time being, we will maintain a hybrid functionality with Zoom (all welcome, from any institution), but most of us will be gathered in the first-floor coffee area of the Battcock. Doughnuts will be provided.

Beginning in the fall of 2022, these talks (which were previously known as "Battcock coffee/doughnut seminars") have returned as the "Hills Coffee Talks" in honour of our late colleague Richard Hills.
