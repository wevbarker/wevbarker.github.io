I submitted my thesis on 25/08/2021. If and when it is passed by the Degree Committee for the faculty of Physics and Chemistry, I'll make a full version available here and also leave it on the arXiv. Eventually, a full version should also find its way to the Cambridge University <a href="https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/">Apollo Repository</a>.

M.Sci. research project

<p>
In Part III of the NST, there is a baby research project, which I did under Prof. Emilio Artacho at the Cavendish Theory of Condensed Matter Group. I'm afraid I only have a scanned copy of mine due to bit rot.
