I submitted my thesis on 25/08/2021. If and when it is passed by the Degree Committee for the faculty of Physics and Chemistry, I'll make a full version available here and also leave it on the arXiv. Eventually, a full version should also find its way to the Cambridge University <a href="https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/">Apollo Repository</a>.
</p>
<p>
<b>Update:</b> I graduated, and a copy is now on the <a href="https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/339554">Apollo Repository</a> with DOI <a href="https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.86972">https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.86972</a>. I decided there is really no need to have it on the arXiv.

Be careful, though, because the rigidity theorem states that if you gather enough mathematical errors into a short enough book you will form a black hole: for this reason the thesis is dangerously unstable.

M.Sci. research project

<p>
In Part III of the NST, there is a baby research project, which I did under Prof. Emilio Artacho at the Cavendish Theory of Condensed Matter Group. I'm afraid I only have a scanned copy of mine due to bit rot.
