Quasi-regular group meetings
</h2>
<p>
Research group meetings for (confirmed) new members, and members who joined as summer students in recent months, will be held in slots from 09:00-14:30 on Fridays (with later slots for those who really can't make the morning). These will be in-person by default, but a Zoom room will be open during that period. Book these below.
