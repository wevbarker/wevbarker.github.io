Attempt to achieve Tim Budd's ergodic Pachner flip for two dimensional Euclidean dynamical triangulations, using a finite number of Burda's link breaking/joining moves on the dual lattice. If there is a well-defined way to preserve the sign flag decoration (i.e. the spin structure) when performing the latter, then we ought to be able to trace it through to the former.

For the current phase of the investigation, we would like to implement a massive Yukawa model to induce some four-fermion interaction in the IR limit. There are a few ways to do this.

The path integral over the Majorana components will result in a Pfaffian.
