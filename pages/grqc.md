A scrolling club for the general relativity and quantum cosmology [gr-qc] sub-arXiv. 
</h1>
<p>
This is a joint initiative between the Central European Institute for Cosmology (CEICO), Institute of Physics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Observatoire astronomique de Strasbourg, the University of Gdańsk, and the University of Cambridge.
</p>
<p>
The following, informal algorithm has been shown to work with similar arXiv clubs. The host screen-shares and scrolls slowly through all submissions (gr-qc and cross-list) since the last meeting. The attendees request numbers, whose abstracts are sequestered in new tabs. At the end of each day's submissions, the tabs are reviewed. Whomever requested the abstract is obliged to lead the discussion. The discussion may even consist of just asking "Does anyone know what X means?", i.e. it should be student-friendly. In interesting cases, the discussion may lead to the preprint being opened. Keep an eye on the clock, you need to get through a whole week in about an hour!
